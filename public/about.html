			<h3>About</h3>

			<p>Project Rhizome was founded with the goal of combining cutting edge data infrastructure development with the creation of attractive urban environments through providing spatial consulting and architectural design services to the data center industry.</p>

			<p>The name of the company is derived from the biological term “rhizome”: a subterranean root structure of a number of species of plants and, most commonly, fungi, renowned for its structural complexity and environmental resilience.</p>

			<p>The infrastructure of the internet is a global rhizome tying together people and businesses. We want to make sure it is designed not only with the functionality but also dignity it deserves.</p>
